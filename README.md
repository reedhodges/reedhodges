## Hi there üëã

### ‚û°Ô∏è I'm currently a particle physics researcher with broad interest in science and technology

- :atom_symbol: My day job is modeling particle physics experiments like those at the Large Hadron Collider
- :man_technologist: I like to work on other coding projects in my spare time
- :seedling: I'm currently learning JavaScript for web apps
